### Documents 📄

- **DAO Project Document**: Comprehensive document outlining the design and implementation of the DAO for Asia Insurance.
- **Smart Contract Document**: Detailed documentation of the smart contract, including all clauses and conditions.
- **Tech Document**: Technical documentation explaining the implementation, compilation, and interaction with the smart contract.

### Source Code 📁

- **compiler**: Contains the `compiler.py` script for compiling and deploying the smart contract.
- **Interact-with-contract**: Contains the `Interact-with-contract.py` script for interacting with the deployed smart contract.
- **smart-contract**: Contains the Solidity source code for the smart contract.

## Overview 🌟

The Asia Insurance DAO Project is designed to improve the efficiency, transparency, and trust in insurance operations by leveraging blockchain technology. This project maintains centralized senior management while decentralizing operations using management and operational tokens.

### Key Features ✨

- **Decentralized Operations**: Insurance experts and trusted repairmen handle claims and complaints using operational tokens.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate policy issuance and claims processing.
- **Oracle Integration**: Ensure accurate and real-time data entry from external sources like police reports and car valuations.
- **Tokenized Governance**: Management and operational tokens govern decision-making and operational processes.

## Smart Contract Design 📝

The smart contract defines the following functionalities:

1. **Policy Issuance**: Senior managers can issue insurance policies.
2. **Claims Processing**: Insurance experts can create, approve, or reject claims.
3. **Oracle Integration**: Accurate data entry for decision-making.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `web3.py`
- Solidity Compiler

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asia-insurance-dao.git
    cd asia-insurance-dao
    ```

2. Install the required Python package:
    ```bash
    pip install web3
    ```

3. Compile and deploy the smart contract using the `compiler.py` script:
    ```bash
    python src/compiler/compiler.py
    ```

4. Interact with the deployed contract using the `Interact-with-contract.py` script:
    ```bash
    python src/Interact-with-contract/Interact-with-contract.py
    ```

## Usage 📘

- **Policy Issuance**: Use the `issue_policy` function in the `Interact-with-contract.py` script to issue a new policy.
- **Create Claim**: Use the `create_claim` function to file a claim.
- **Approve/Reject Claim**: Use the `approve_claim` and `reject_claim` functions to manage claims.
